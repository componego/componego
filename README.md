It is a framework for building applications based on components. They can be used in several applications and can be
interchangeable. This is only needed to initialize the application. It does NOT affect the main loop of your application.
You can still use your favorite frameworks and libraries. We allow you to wrap them in components.

Components may depend on other components. They can be expanded or reduced depending on your requirements.
Components are not microservices. These are folders that contain different functionality.

The framework has very low coupling within its code. All entities are optional.

We provide the ability to use dependency injecting, configuration, and error handling.
However, one of the framework's main features is that you can rewrite entities without changing the application code.
This opens up the possibility of creating mocks for any part of your application without changing the code.

If your application is divided into components (modules), then this further separates your code into different services
and allows you to reuse it in your other applications. Of course, you donâ€™t need to make the components too small.

### Documentation

Visit our website to learn more: [componego.github.io](https://componego.github.io/).

Documentation is active for the latest version of the framework.
Please update your version to [the latest](https://github.com/componego/componego/releases).

### Examples

You can find some examples [here](./examples).

A typical application using this framework looks like [this](./examples/url-shortener-app/internal/application/application.go).

### Skeleton

You can quickly create a basic application in several ways:
```shell
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/componego/componego/master/tools/create-basic-app.sh | sh
```
or
```shell
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/componego/componego/master/tools/create-basic-app.sh | sh
```
On Windows, you can run the above commands with Git Bash, which comes with [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
